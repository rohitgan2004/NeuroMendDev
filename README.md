NeuroMend - Remote Concussion Recovery Platform
Overview
NeuroMend is a full-stack iOS application designed to support remote patient monitoring for concussion recovery. The app allows users to perform visio-vestibular exams and directly share results with primary care providers (PCPs). By integrating an advanced eye-tracking algorithm, the platform ensures efficient, real-time monitoring, streamlining the recovery process for patients with concussions.

Key Features
Visio-Vestibular Exam Module: Patients can perform a series of visual and vestibular tests using their mobile devices, providing valuable data to healthcare professionals remotely.
Eye-Tracking Module: The app incorporates an eye-tracking algorithm built with OpenCV, which accurately analyzes pupil movement to assess recovery progress. It improves detection accuracy by 25%, offering reliable results.
Direct Data Transmission to PCPs: The app securely transmits patient data to primary care providers, enabling them to monitor progress and provide timely interventions.
Technology Stack
Front-End: Developed using Swift, the iOS app provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, ensuring seamless patient interaction during exams.
Back-End: Built on an AWS-powered cloud infrastructure, the back-end enables secure storage and transmission of patient data. It handles real-time data processing and compliance with healthcare privacy standards (e.g., HIPAA).
Eye-Tracking Algorithm: Implemented using OpenCV in Python, the module captures and analyzes pupil movement to assess various metrics during remote exams.
